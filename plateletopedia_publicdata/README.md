# `_publicdata` folder

This folder contains the data from different public sources, including:

- datasets (from SRA/GEO) on published articles
- datasets publicly available from GEO/SRA, yet not yet linked to a publication
- datasets from reference atlases/consortia data (e.g. BLUEPRINT, GTEx, Illumina BodyMap, ...)

Each project is structured with the same subfolder tree, for ease of navigation.
Correspondingly, all derived files and quantifications are stored in the dedicated folders.
