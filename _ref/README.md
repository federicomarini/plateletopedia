# `_ref` folder

This folder contains all the required `ref`erence files, starting from the original genome sequences, and its companion resources.
Normally these are retrieved from the ENSEMBL website.

The derived files, e.g. indices for running the alignment/quantification steps, or performing additional quality controls, are also stored in here, with a prefix structure to make their provenance and aim as clear as possible.
